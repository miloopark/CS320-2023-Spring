(*
The following function int5_sort
is based on ListMergeSort.sort, which is
defined recursively. Given a tuple of 5
integers, int5_sort returns an ordered tuple
of the same 5 integers. For instance,
int5_sort(1, 2, 1, 2, 2) = (1, 1, 2, 2, 2)
int5_sort(3, 1, 2, 5, 2) = (1, 2, 2, 3, 5)
int5_sort(3, 1, 2, 5, 4) = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
*)

int5_sort =
fn(xs: int5): int5 =
let
val (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5) = xs
val ys =
ListMergeSort.sort(op>=)[x1,x2,x3,x4,x5]
val y1 = hd(ys) and ys = tl(ys)
val y2 = hd(ys) and ys = tl(ys)
val y3 = hd(ys) and ys = tl(ys)
val y4 = hd(ys) and ys = tl(ys)
val y5 = hd(ys) and ys = tl(ys)

Please give a non-recursive implementation of int5_sort
as int5_sort_nr. That is, please implement int5_sort_nr
in a non-recursive manner such that int5_sort(xs) equals
int5_sort_nr(xs) for every 5-tuple xs of the type int5.
